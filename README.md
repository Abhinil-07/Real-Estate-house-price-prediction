# House Price Prediction Project using Machine Learning

This repository contains a simple machine learning model for predicting house prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and the machine learning model utilizes the Scikit-learn library.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Boston Housing" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains various features associated with houses in Boston, such as average room numbers, crime rate, accessibility to highways, etc. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

You can find the dataset here: [Boston Housing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd)

## Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. The notebook contains all the code for data preprocessing, training the machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell sequentially.

## Model Building
In this project, we use a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices. The algorithm used is the Decision Tree Regressor from Scikit-learn. Decision trees are powerful models for regression tasks and can handle both categorical and numerical features.

## Results
After training and evaluating the model on the Boston Housing dataset, we achieved a reasonable performance with a mean squared error (MSE) of X, which indicates how closely the predicted prices match the actual prices. Keep in mind that the performance of the model can vary depending on various factors like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
